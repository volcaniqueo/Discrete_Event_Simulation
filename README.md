# Discrete_Event_Simulation
This project was my 2nd Homework for the course CMPE 250 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at Bogazici University.
## About the Project
This project was about discrete event simulation. Detailed story about the project can be found in the description. Two visualization examples of the DES can be also found in the repository. The main approach to implement a DES scenerio is to understand that 'Time is not continious, time moves onto from one event's time to another'. With this approach, I implemented the project, following proper object oriented design principles.
## To Run the Code
First compile using:
```javac CMPE250_HW2_volcaniqueo/src/*.java -d CMPE250_HW2_volcaniqueo/bin```

Then move onto bin:
```cd CMPE250_HW2_volcaniqueo/bin```

Finally run using arguments:
```java project2main <input_file> <output_file>```
